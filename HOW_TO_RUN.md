# How to Run "What to Watch"

## ❌ Do NOT do this:
*   Do **NOT** click the "Run" button (▶️) when `vite.config.ts` or `launch.json` is open. These are settings files, not programs!

## ✅ Do this instead:

### Option 1: The Easy Way (Browser)
The app is likely already running in the background!
👉 **[Click this link to open](http://127.0.0.1:5173)**

### Option 2: Start from Scratch (Terminal)
If the link doesn't work:
1.  Open a Terminal in VS Code (`Ctrl + ~`).
2.  Type: `cd what-to-watch`
3.  Type: `npm run dev`
4.  **Ctrl + Click** the link it shows you.
